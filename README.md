## Contributing
- Prefer tools that are easily picked up by even a relatively new developer. This site should be easy for community members to edit.
- To run the server locally, use `guard`
  - this will run `jekyll serve` and run [livereload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
- To set up LiveReload
  - install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)
  - run `guard` locally
- Debugging - make sure `jekyll build` runs locally with no errors
