# Don't Call Us, We'll Call You
## Library
- Performs a specific operation
- Re-usable code or a collection of routines
- Easier to swap out if one library doesn't work, swapping a Framework could be like starting a project over

## Framework
- The skeleton that helps structure the meat
- Provides your code with a frame (saves time)
- Helps add consistency to the project
- Can contain a library

### Don't Call us: 
Framework: You don't ask the framework to do anything, it waits for your code and then runs it through it's skeleton and prints it to the page.
### We'll Call You: 
Library: You ask the library to help you do a specific task by calling it.
