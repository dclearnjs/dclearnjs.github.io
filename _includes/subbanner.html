      We meet bi-monthly and offer a plethora of things to do! We will be having lab hours where people can bring their own projects, tutorials, books, and lessons and ask questions and receive help. We will be having talks or planned instruction on occasion on topics that are appealing to beginners and long-time JavaScripters alike.
